Problem
- Create a program that returns all possible consecutive number sequences
for a given length

Examples:
- For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:
012
123
234

- And here are the 4-digit series:
0123
1234

- GIVEN

Data Structure:
input: string (number sequence) and integer (length to evaluate)
output: array of arrays (containing valid sequences)

Algorithm:
- Constructor
  - store string of the number sequence
- #slices
  - take input of length to evaluate
  - iterate through the string by chunks of the specified length
    - append each sequence to an array that are of consecutive values
  - return array
