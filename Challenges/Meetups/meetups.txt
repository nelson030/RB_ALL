Problem

- Give month and year when creating an object. Then, be able to
find the correct date (Date object) given two arguments
(dayofweek, #ofoccurence)

- For instance, if you ask for the 2nd Wednesday of May 2021, 
the object should be able to determine that the meetup for 
that month will occur on the 12th of May, 2021.


Example:
- Meetup.new(2013, 3).day('Monday', 'first') == 
Date.civil(2013, 3, 4)

- GIVEN

Data Structure:
- input: 2 integers (year, month)
  - also 2 strings (day, occurence)
- output: Date object

- store year and month in instance variables

Algorithm:
- Constructor
  - store year and month as integer values as instance variables
- #day
  - assign 2 strings (day_str, occurence)
  - change occurence into an integer or an array of a range
  - create integer = 1 (day)
  - cycle through the month of the year given
    - determine if the Date object with that day satisfies
    both day_str and occurence requirements
  - return the Date object
  
- #assign_occurences
  - cycle through given month/year
    - assign each occurence for each day of month
      - ie for the first monday -> {"1st Monday" => Date.civil(2013, 4, 1) }
    - return hash
