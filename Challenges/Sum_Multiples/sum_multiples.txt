Problem
- Write a program that, given a natural number and a 
set of one or more other numbers, can find the sum of 
all the multiples of the numbers in the set that are 
less than the first number. 
If the set of numbers is not given, use a default set 
of 3 and 5.

Examples
- GIVEN

Data Structure
- 2 inputs: integer (natural number) and array of integers (maybe)
- output: integer (sum of multiples)

Algorithm
- Contructor
  - create an attr_readr for array of numbers of given input(s)
  - sort! array
- ::to(num)
  - create a new SumOfMultiples object
  - call and return #to(num)
- #to(num)
  - iterate every number (excluding num) to num
  - sum multiples of each num of array
  - return sum
