Understanding the Problem:

- Determine whether a given triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
  - An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.
  - An isosceles triangle has exactly two sides of the same length.
  - A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.
  
Requirements
- all sides must be of length > 0
- and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length 
of the third side.

Questions:
- How do we "receive" the triangle? Probably by defining the 3 side lengths.

Examples/tests
- GIVEN (triangles_test.rb)

More Requirements
- need a contructor with input of 3 side lengths
- need an instance method `kind` returning string of type of triangle

Data Structure
- store `Triangle` objects in a local variable
- When calling `kind` on a triangle object, we want a String returned (nothing
needs to be printed)
- Store instance variables of each side length to an array
  - Will be read only
  - Needed for `kind` method to evaluate triangle type

Algorithm
- constructor
  - assign side lengths to array (attr_reader)
  - return ArgumentError if
    - all sides are not > 0
    - largest side length is larger than (AND NOT EQUAL TO) sum of other 2 sides
- `kind` method
  - accesses instance variable array of side lengths
  - determines what kind of triangle it is

Question:
- How to store formulas for the different types of triangles?
