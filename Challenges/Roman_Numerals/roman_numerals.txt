Problem
- Create program that converts integer into Roman numeral equivalent

Definitions:
- I = 1
- V = 5
- X = 10
- L = 50
- C = 100
- D = 500
- M = 1000

Questions:
- How to create an algorithm that doesnt need every input, but can calculate itself?
  - Or does every input need to be specified?
- What is the pattern to roman numerals?

Examples
- GIVEN

Data Structure
- Input an integer into constructor. Save that as year value
- #to_roman method converts integer into string representing Roman numeral

Algorithm
- Contructor
  - input and store integer as year
- #to_roman
  - convert number to Rom num
    - HOW?
      - have different methods to convert the different place (ones, tens,
      hundreds, thousands)
      - combine the roman numerals in correct order
  - return string
  - no output

Code
